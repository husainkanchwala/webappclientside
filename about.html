          <h1>About Us</h1>
            Bertha has been producing the world’s finest chocolate in the small village of Tain L’Hermitage, San Diego since 1922. From the beginning, company founder and Pastry Chef Albéric Guironnet was dedicated to the creation of unique, artisan quality chocolate with complex, balanced and consistent flavors. This mission of excellence continues as the gastronomic traditions of the renowned Rhone Valley find expression in every mouthwatering taste of Bertha’s superb chocolate. For almost a century, Bertha has created a range of unique and recognizable aromatic profiles by perfecting techniques for enhancing the flavor of rare cocoa beans, grown on land masterfully selected for its terroir. Today, leading Pastry Chefs and discerning gourmets rely on Bertha’s expertise to experience the best that chocolate can be.
